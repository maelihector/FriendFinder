# FriendFinder
## What is this?

FriendFinder is compatibility-based application that uses [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) to handle routing.  
## What does it do?

FriendFinder takes in results from user's surveys, compares their answers with those from other users, and then displays the name and picture of a user with the overall match.

## How does it work?
FriendFinder is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com). Click [here](https://afternoon-wildwood-74916.herokuapp.com/) to check it out. Once there, just click on the 'Go to Survey' button and start filling out the survey.
